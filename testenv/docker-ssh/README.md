# Docker SSH workers (CI E2E)

Real OpenSSH + rsync Linux workers. CI remote SSH coverage uses this stack
([`SSH E2E`](../../.github/workflows/CI.yml)). Optional Mac-only path
(same image and `test/e2e.jl`):
[`../apple-container-ssh`](../apple-container-ssh) — `./scripts/up.sh --e2e`
(Apple `container`; **not CI**). Do not run both stacks at once (shared
`ssh_config`).

## Coverage matrix

- Linux (`ubuntu-latest`), workers `ubuntu:24.04` ×2: **CI** —
  `ubuntu-latest → ubuntu-24.04` (path filter, a version-cut PR, dispatch)
- macOS Intel (`macos-15-intel` + Colima), same image: **E2E weekly** —
  `macos-15-intel → ubuntu-24.04`
- Either kit parent, `parent:N`: mixed smoke inside the same suite

Suite inventory: [`test/README.md`](../../test/README.md#ssh-e2e).

### Honest limits

- CI macOS kit parent is **weekly / dispatch** (`macos-15-intel` +
  Colima). Apple Silicon GitHub runners cannot nest VMs.
- Remote Julia detection is exercised on **Linux workers**.
- **Not covered (no free CI):** Linux kit parent → macOS worker; Mac workers
  (local: [`apple-container-ssh`](../apple-container-ssh/README.md)
  `./scripts/up.sh --e2e`).
- **Git parity (`--require-git`):** covered via a separate git remote root
  (`clone` from a bare on child-1 → `--sync` → `drive --require-git`).
  Mismatch before `--sync` must fail. `--pull` after a kit parent `git push`
  is checked by reading `e2e_sync_marker.txt` on the workers.
  The rsync path still excludes `.git/` and does not claim parity.

Worker image installs **two** juliaup channels from
[`.github/julia-slots.env`](../../.github/julia-slots.env):

- **default** = the stable line (today **1.13**) — matches the E2E
  kit parent so `--check` runs **without** `--ignore-julia-version`
- **alt** = `JULIA_E2E_MISMATCH_CHANNEL` (today **1.12**) — a different
  major.minor so E2E can `juliaup default` to mismatch, then
  `setup --juliaup` to realign. Not a supported floor and not a Pkg.test slot.

`up.sh` passes both as Docker / `container` build-args and exports
`DISTSSHKIT_E2E_JULIA_{DEFAULT,ALT}_CHANNEL` for `test/e2e.jl`. On the build
path it also resolves each channel's current release from `versions.json`
(`JULIA_DEFAULT_RELEASE` / `JULIA_ALT_RELEASE`). That string is the image
cache key, so a new patch, or a prerelease becoming stable, rebuilds the
juliaup layer. The image build checks `julia --version` against it. Only
major.minor is required at runtime. Install policy:
[Requirements](https://yamanori99.github.io/DistSSHKit.jl/dev/requirements/).
`--e2e` also runs
[`scripts/ensure-kit-parent-juliaup.sh`](scripts/ensure-kit-parent-juliaup.sh)
so the kit parent has juliaup + both channels (`setup --juliaup parent`;
CI `setup-julia` alone does not install juliaup).

On macOS, publish ports on `127.0.0.1` (Docker Desktop / Colima defaults)
so macOS 15 Local
Network Privacy does not block SSH from the kit parent.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) / [`start.sh`](start.sh) | Worker image |
| [`compose.yml`](compose.yml) | Two children (`child-1` / `child-2`) |
| [`scripts/julia-channels.sh`](scripts/julia-channels.sh) | slots → juliaup channel and release build-args |
| [`scripts/ensure-kit-parent-juliaup.sh`](scripts/ensure-kit-parent-juliaup.sh) | kit parent juliaup + channels for `--e2e` |
| [`scripts/gen-keys.sh`](scripts/gen-keys.sh) | Keys and SSH config |
| [`scripts/up.sh`](scripts/up.sh) | Keys → compose up → wait |
| [`scripts/wait-ready.sh`](scripts/wait-ready.sh) | SSH + Julia probe |
| [`scripts/down.sh`](scripts/down.sh) | Compose down |
| [`scripts/setup-colima-ci.sh`](scripts/setup-colima-ci.sh) | Colima CI |
| `.generated/` | gitignored SSH config / keys (created by scripts) |

SSH hosts (written to `.generated/ssh_config`):

- `child-1` → `127.0.0.1:2222` user `dev`
- `child-2` → `127.0.0.1:2223` user `dev`

## Local use (macOS, Linux, or WSL2)

Requires Docker Compose (Docker Desktop on Mac is fine; on WSL2, Docker must be
visible from the distro). Keep a WSL tree under `~/…`, not `/mnt/c/…`.

```bash
./scripts/up.sh --e2e    # workers + suite (always from kit root)
./scripts/up.sh          # workers only
./scripts/down.sh
```

Skip the Julia-in-Docker build (macOS / WSL) by pulling the public image from
`main`'s last successful `E2E weekly`. If you changed `Dockerfile` /
`compose.yml`,
build locally instead (omit `DISTSSHKIT_WORKER_IMAGE`).

```bash
export DISTSSHKIT_WORKER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/yamanori99/\
distsshup-linux-ssh-worker:latest
./scripts/up.sh --e2e
```

On a Mac or in WSL2 this is how you cover that kit parent against Linux workers.
Suite coverage / artifacts: see `test/e2e.jl` and
`test/artifacts/README.md` (`$(cat test/artifacts/ssh-e2e/LATEST)/SUMMARY.txt`,
plus `JULIA_PATHS.txt`).

Manual smoke:

```bash
./scripts/up.sh
ssh -F .generated/ssh_config child-1 'echo ok; julia --version'
```

## CI

[`.github/workflows/CI.yml`](../../.github/workflows/CI.yml) runs
`./scripts/up.sh --e2e` on `ubuntu-latest` for **main** (E2E-relevant
paths), a PR whose `Project.toml` `version` went up, and manual dispatch
(`ubuntu-latest → ubuntu-24.04`). Other PRs run it only when those paths
change.
[`.github/workflows/ssh-e2e-weekly.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ssh-e2e-weekly.yml)
(`E2E weekly`) runs Sunday 04:00 JST, via Run workflow, or on a version
increase pushed to `main`: bake `ubuntu-latest (image)` to GHCR, then
`macos-15-intel` pulls that tag and runs the suite. Intel is a watcher, not a
PR check. Register from the version-cut PR's Linux E2E.

The Mac job waits for `ubuntu-latest (image)` then pulls
`ghcr.io/<owner>/distsshup-linux-ssh-worker:<sha>` instead of building
Julia-in-Docker on Colima. Local `./scripts/up.sh` still builds unless you set
`DISTSSHKIT_WORKER_IMAGE`. Colima on Intel runners uses `--cpu 3 --memory 8`
so the Darwin kit parent keeps RAM.

Usual `Pkg.test()` does **not** start Docker and does **not** run this suite.
